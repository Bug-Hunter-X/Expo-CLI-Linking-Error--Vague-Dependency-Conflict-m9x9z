While building an Expo app, I encountered a peculiar error during the linking process.  The error message was vague, mentioning something about a dependency conflict, but it didn't specify which dependencies were conflicting.  The exact error message was: `Error: Unable to resolve module `react-native-gesture-handler` from `/path/to/my/project/node_modules/react-native-reanimated/lib/reanimated2/js/src/utils/`.  I tried `expo prebuild` and `expo install` without success. The `package.json` file shows `react-native-gesture-handler` and `react-native-reanimated` as dependencies.
