The solution involved carefully reviewing the versions of `react-native-gesture-handler` and `react-native-reanimated` listed in the project's `package.json` and their documentation.  By identifying a mismatch or incompatibility, a compatible version for both packages was selected and installed.  In some cases, I had to manually remove the `node_modules` folder and then reinstall the dependencies.  This process ensured both packages worked correctly together and resolved the linking problem.  Below is an updated package.json that shows updated compatible versions:

```json
{
  // ... other dependencies ...
  "react-native-gesture-handler": "^2.11.0",
  "react-native-reanimated": "^2.14.4"
}
```
In the rare scenario that neither updating nor reinstalling the packages worked, an alternative approach is to remove both packages entirely from the `package.json`, clear the cache (including `node_modules`), reinstall the packages, and then try to rebuild the project. This more aggressive approach can address deep-seated package issues.
